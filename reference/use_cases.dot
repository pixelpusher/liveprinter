 # Use cases

 ## Moving (e.g. traveling)

 Moving the print head into position to start printing; moving out of the way after finishing a print; or moving in order to make a sound.

 1. moving the print head from the current position to a _specific location_ (x,y,z) in the print cavity
 2. moving the print head a specific amount from the current position in the x,y,z direction (e.g. 10mm to the right, 2mm up )
 3. moving the print head a specific amount from the current position and at a specific 2D angle, possibly also with an angle of elevation (i.e. either upwards or downwards)
 
 ## Printing (e.g. extruding)

 Extruding filament to build up plastic forms on the print bed (e.g. building up a form 2D layer-by-layer, or in a single extruded blog), or in the air (like WirePrint); reversing (retracting) filament to prevent leakage or perform maintenance like changing the filament; forwarding filament in the tube until it is inside the print head and ready for further printing operations

 1. printing a line from the current position to a _specific location_ (x,y,z) in the print cavity
 2.  printing a line with the length of a specific amount from the current position in the x,y,z direction (e.g. 10mm to the right, 2mm up )
 3. printing a line with the length of a specific amount from the current position and at a specific 2D angle, possibly also with an angle of elevation (i.e. either upwards or downwards)
 4. moving the filament backwards into the tube and then changing it, or cleaning the head, and then forwards again until it is prinedin the print head
 
## Waiting

Pausing printing and traveling for a specific amount of time

1. waiting for the extruded plastic to cool after a print move
2. in a musical sense, waiting a few "beats" as part of a melody

 /*

test cases: 

1. retract -> travel -> travel  (should stay retracted)
2. unretract -> travel -> travel (should retract at start and stay retracted)
3. retract -> extrude manual (e value only) -> shouldn't retract at start or at end
4. retract -> extrude normal (should be retracted at end)
5. retract -> extrude normal -> travel (should be retracted at end)
6. retract -> unretract -> extrude normal (should be retracted at end)
7. retract -> extrude normal w/retraction disabled (should unretract before and be unretracted at end)
